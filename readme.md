# Open source firmware for the Zoyi ZT-703S

Work in progress

General:
- [X] USB mass storage mode
- [X] FatFS
- [X] USB-CDC mode for remote control
- [X] menu system
- [ ] load and save settings on power up/down
- [X] bootloader
- [ ] bootloader update functionality
- [ ] screenshot

DMM:
- [X] recreate original functionality
- [ ] ~~switchable analog scale (bargraph)~~
- [X] add CSV compatible logging
- [X] add graph history
- [ ] add limits <- current goal
- [X] add a 4-20mA mode
- [X] add RTD (Pt100 / Pt500 / Pt1000 / Pt2000) temperature measurement mode
- [ ] add TC temperature measurement mode

Scope:
- [ ] no overclocking
- [ ] proper triggering, even if the display has to be swithed off
- [ ] user control of sampling speed, memory depth
- [ ] equivalent sampling for repeating signals
- [ ] voltage calibration

Signal generator (still a toy):
- [X] PWM output
- [ ] Noise output
- [ ] Triangle wave output
- [ ] Sine wave output, with autogenerated lookup table
- [ ] Sawtooth wave output, with autogenerated lookup table
- [ ] user stored waveforms in addition to the standard ones

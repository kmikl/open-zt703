Open source firmware for the Zoyi ZT-703S <br />
<br />
Work in progress <br />
 <br />
Goals: <br />
<br />
General: <br />
 USB mass storage mode <-done <br />
<br />
DMM: <br />
 recreate original functionality <-done <br />
 switchable analog scale (bargraph) <br />
 add CSV logging <br />
 add graph history <-done <br />
 add CDC to the USB mode for remote control of the DMM <-done <br />
 add limits <-current goal <br />
 add a 4-20mA mode <br />
 add a temperature measurement mode <br />
 <br />
Scope: <br />
 no overclocking <br />
 proper triggering, even if the display has to be swithed off <br />
 user control of sampling speed, memory depth <br />
 equivalent sampling for repeating signals <br />
 voltage calibration <br />
 <br />
Signal generator (still a toy): <br />
 PWM output <-done <br />
 Noise output <br />
 Triangle wave output <br />
 Sine wave output, with autogenerated lookup table <br />
 Sawtooth wave output, with autogenerated lookup table <br />
 user stored waveforms in addition to the standard ones <br />

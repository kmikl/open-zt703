# Open source firmware for the Zoyi ZT-703S

Work in progress

## Known bugs and limitations
- the battery level display needs hysteresis added, voltage levels set correctly and testing
- the pretty buggy DMM chip sometimes just freezes and stops sending data to the MCU. Looks like, this only happens, when switching modes or saving a screenshot. Some code needed to detect this and reboot the chip. There are already a lot of CPU cycles wasted to work around the bugs of the chip...

## Features
### General:
- [X] USB mass storage mode
- [X] FatFS
- [X] USB-CDC mode for remote control
- [X] menu system
- [X] load and save settings on power up/down
- [X] bootloader
- [ ] bootloader update functionality
- [X] screenshots
- [ ] auto power off <- current goal
- [ ] auto screen dimming / power off
- [ ] low battery voltage power off

### DMM:
- [X] recreate original functionality
- [X] recreate analog scale
- [X] add CSV compatible logging
- [X] add graph history
- [X] add averaging
- [X] add limits
- [X] add a 4-20mA mode
- [X] add RTD (Pt100 / Pt500 / Pt1000 / Pt2000) temperature measurement mode
- [X] add TC (B, E, J, K, N, R, S, T) temperature measurement mode
- [X] add graph buffer dumping to file additionally to a screenshot

### Scope:
- [ ] basic functions
- [ ] cursors
- [ ] measurements
- [ ] math channel (add and substract only)
- [ ] add user control of sampling speed, memory depth
- [ ] add voltage calibration
- [ ] add capture buffer dumping to file additionally to a screenshot
- [ ] X-Y mode
- [ ] persistance
- [ ] auto set-up of parameters (low priority)
- [ ] FFT (even lower priority)

### Additional features
- [ ] add a counter mode
- [ ] add a quadrature encoder mode
- [ ] add decoders for 2-wire serial protocols (RS422/RS485, RS232, I2C, maybe CAN is also possible)

### Signal generator (still a toy):
- [X] PWM output
- [ ] Noise output
- [ ] Triangle wave output
- [ ] DC voltage output
- [ ] Serial output from a file
- [ ] Sine wave output, with autogenerated lookup table (not usable in scope mode)
- [ ] Sawtooth wave output, with autogenerated lookup table (not usable in scope mode)
- [ ] user stored waveforms in addition to the standard ones (not usable in scope mode)

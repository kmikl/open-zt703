# Open source firmware for the Zoyi ZT-703S

Work in progress

General:
- [X] USB mass storage mode
- [X] get FatFS working
- [X] add CDC to the USB mode for remote control

DMM:
- [X] recreate original functionality
- [ ] switchable analog scale (bargraph)
- [ ] add CSV logging
- [X] add graph history
- [ ] add limits <-current goal
- [ ] add a 4-20mA mode
- [ ] add a temperature measurement mode

Scope:
- [ ] no overclocking
- [ ] proper triggering, even if the display has to be swithed off
- [ ] user control of sampling speed, memory depth
- [ ] equivalent sampling for repeating signals
- [ ] voltage calibration

Signal generator (still a toy):
- [X] PWM output
- [ ] Noise output
- [ ] Triangle wave output
- [ ] Sine wave output, with autogenerated lookup table
- [ ] Sawtooth wave output, with autogenerated lookup table
- [ ] user stored waveforms in addition to the standard ones
